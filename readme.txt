In this project, I built build a JavaScript version of "Hot or Cold" (commonly known as "Huckle buckle beanstalk", obviously!). You remember the game, don't you? The hider knows where one object is, and a seeker has to find it. Each time the seeker makes a guess, the hider responds "getting hotter" if she's getting closer, or "getting colder" if she's moved farther away. For my  version of the game, the computer will be hiding a number, and your user will be trying to find it.

This game,  uses functions, conditionals, random numbers, and a "scoped" variable.
